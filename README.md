# Collection of Algorithims :green_book:

This repo serves as a record of the different sorting algorithims I have implemented in Python.

## Description

Honestly, there isn't much to it.  In order for me to actually understand an algorithim I need to analyze it and put it in practice, and I wanted to save my progress.  Most of the algorithims are not super optimized for either space or speed, but moreso for readability in order for myself to easily look back them and remember how they work at some point in the future.

## Current Algorithims Created:

* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Bogo Sort

## Planned Algorithims:
* Quick Sort
* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Heap Sort

## License

Come on i'm not going to try and license basic implentations of common sorting algorithims, i'm not EA games.
